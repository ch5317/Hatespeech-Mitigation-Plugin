## Other notes/references

- [Adblock Plus source code](https://github.com/adblockplus/adblockpluschrome): a good reference for UI code
- [web-ext tool](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/): command-line tool that detects changes to the plugin source code and automatically reloads it in Firefox, saves a lot of time
